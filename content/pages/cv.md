# Spencer Nelson #
I'm a data generalist. My skills run from model-building and statistics, through frontend full-stack development, up to large-scale system architecture. I pride myself on my ability to design clean abstractions around large piles of data.

I have a quantitative background, and I think of models and statistical summaries as abstractions wrapping up complexities in a dataset. I also have a web development backrgound, so I think a lot about designing tools in an extensible fashion. I'm a firm believer that virtually all analysis scripts should be simple web apps: it forces clarity in data quality and munging, encourages reproducability and shareability, and makes things much more maintainable.

## Technical Skills
I think I'd qualify as a Python expert, and I know more about Postgres than most web developers.

I know enough HTML/CSS/JS to get things done quickly. My skill level is similar in devops: I know enough to be able to get an EC2 box to run my Flask server without thinking too hard.

Things I use regularly enough that I'm comfortable talking about them at length:

 * Python
      * The Scipy stack: pandas, ipython, matplotlib, scipy, numpy
      * Web App Development: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Django
      * AWS tools: boto, mrjob
 * JavaScript
      * Toolbelts: underscore.js, jQuery
      * Frameworks: Backbone
      * Visualization: d3.js, Highcharts
 * Systems
      * OSes: Ubuntu, OSX, anything unix
      * Databases: Postgres
      * Servers: nginx, uwsgi
      * Source Control: git

## Experience

### Twitch 
**Data Science Lead (Jan 2013-present)**

I joined Twitch to start the Data Science team. I grew the team to 5, including myself. We analyze many terabytes of user data to guide decision-making. I spend most of my time building tools to liberate data from silos, letting anyone analyze it.

 * Grew team to 5, managing 3 engineers and 1 data scientist.
 * Added tracking all over the application, in Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and ActionScript.
 * Built forecasting models to predict site load with a level of accuracy that was described as 'creepy'
 * Wrote a dashboard in Flask and d3 to let nontechnical users explore data
 * Built an a/b testing system: analysis with bootstrapped confidence intervals, results presented through d3
 * Built automated advertising fraud detection system using an combination of SVM and naive heuristics
 * Architected a cloud-based pipeline for collecting analytics data (described [here](http://ossareh.posthaven.com/the-twitch-statistics-pipeline))
 * Investigated lots and lots of stuff to help people make better data-based decisions

### ZeroCater
**Full-Stack Web Engineer (Sep 2011-Nov 2012)**

I was an early hire at ZeroCater, working all over the web stack (which was Django + nginx + apache + Postgres).

 * Hired and led the engineering team (3 engineers)
 * Wrote many, many, many internal tools for managing meal delivery, all in Django and Backbone.
 * Rewrote billing system, routing millions of dollars of payments from hundreds of companies to hundreds of restaurants
 * Designed and built a dashboard for tracking company KPIs and revenue
 * Refactored and restructured large swaths of the Django codebase
 * Managed all systems: nginx, apache, a Postgres database, and our EC2 resources.

## Education

**BA in Astrophysics, Northwestern University, 2011**

Graduated with honors. Wrote a senior thesis on statistical analysis of interstellar molecular hydrogen structure. Took classes on data

**Edgemont High School, Scarsdale NY, 2007**

Competitive Policy Debater, won state championship and several national circuit tournaments.
