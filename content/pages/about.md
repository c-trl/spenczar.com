Title: about

I'm a data scientist at [Twitch](http://www.twitch.tv/). I handle the whole data pipeline, from tracking to model-building to reporting.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time making dashboards using [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/)'s fabulous [d3](http://d3js.org/) library.

Previously, I was a web developer generalist type guy at [ZeroCater](http://www.zerocater.com/).

I spend most of my time in Python (more specifically, [IPython](http://ipython.org/) + [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)), but I also do a lot of work in Ruby, JavaScript, and [R](https://github.com/tdsmith/aRrgh).
